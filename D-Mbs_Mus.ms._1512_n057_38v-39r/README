Notes:

- measure 4, tstamp 4,5: what is the last upper note of the measure? (C#5) (same in measure 27, tstamp 1,5)
- measure 17, staff 1, tstamp 1-3: there is a mistake in the MS - rhythm is only 2 8ths but there are 4 notes written (possibly all 8ths?)
- measure 19, staff 1, layer 2, tstamp 3: is that a 3 (B3)?
- measure 20, staff 1, layer 2, tstamp 3: is that a crossed b (C#4)?
- measure 22, staff 1, tstamp 2 and 4: difficult to recognize - is it "v" oder "p"?
- measure 24, staff 1, tstamp 3,5 and 4,25: "5" was difficult to recognize - screenshot?
- measure 27, staff ?, tstamp 1,5: what is the upper note? - same as in measure 4, tstamp 4,5
- measure 30, staff 1, tstamp 4,25: "5" was difficult to recognize - screenshot?
